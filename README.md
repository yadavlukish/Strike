# Microsoft Security Incident Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive analytics framework using the Microsoft Security Incident dataset to proactively identify potential security incidents. The primary goal is to enhance organizational security measures through data-driven insights and predictive modeling.

## Objective
To create a comprehensive analytical framework that can:
- Predict potential security incidents before they occur
- Identify patterns and trends in security-related data
- Provide actionable insights for proactive security measures
- Enhance overall organizational security posture

## Methodology
Our analysis was conducted using Cursor IDE, following a structured approach:

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Downloaded the Microsoft Security Incident Prediction dataset
- Extracted and processed metadata from Kaggle
- Converted metadata to JSON format for better accessibility

### 2. Feature Analysis & Hypothesis Formation
- Leveraged LLM to:
  - Analyze column descriptions from JSON
  - Form initial hypotheses
  - Create hierarchical categorization of features
- Conducted manual review and validation of LLM suggestions
- Refined feature categorization based on domain expertise

### 3. Data Analysis Framework
Developed exploratory analysis approaches including:
- Initial classification model concepts
- Basic time series analysis ideas
- Preliminary anomaly detection approaches
- Potential feature engineering strategies

## Analysis Components (Exploratory Phase)

### Classification Analysis (Baseline Approach)
- Identified potential classification techniques suitable for security incidents
- Listed possible algorithms for future implementation
- Outlined evaluation metrics to be considered
- **Note**: No actual implementation - conceptual framework only

### Time Series Analysis (Preliminary Planning)
- Documented potential temporal patterns to investigate
- Listed time series techniques applicable to security data
- Identified key temporal features for future analysis
- **Note**: Exploratory planning phase only - no implementation

### Anomaly Detection (Conceptual Framework)
- Researched suitable anomaly detection approaches
- Outlined potential baseline behavior metrics
- Listed possible threat identification methods
- **Note**: Theoretical approach - no actual implementation

### Feature Engineering (Initial Ideas)
- Brainstormed potential feature derivations
- Listed domain-specific transformations to consider
- Documented feature selection strategies
- **Note**: Conceptual phase - no actual feature creation

## Tools Used
- Cursor IDE for development and analysis
- Python for data processing and modeling
- Various ML libraries (specific libraries to be listed)
- LLM for initial analysis and hypothesis formation

## Future Implementation Steps
- Develop and implement actual classification models
- Create working time series analysis pipeline
- Build anomaly detection system
- Implement proposed feature engineering ideas
- Create modular code structure
- Develop testing framework
- Create proper documentation
